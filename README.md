# 🧠 The Learners

**The Learners** is an interactive educational website created for students and self-learners.  
Its main goal is to provide **free and easy access** to quality educational materials — including **subject-wise PDF notes**, **reference books**, and **study resources** — all in one organized platform.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This website is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Intro Page** – handles user interaction using prompt, confirm, and alert functions.  
2. **Main Website (The Learners)** – includes the navigation bar, hero section, about section, help section, and footer.

The overall design follows a **warm brown & beige color theme**, which can also be dynamically changed through JavaScript.

## 💡 Key Functionalities

### 🗣️ User Interaction  
The intro page collects basic user input using JavaScript's `prompt`, `confirm`, and `alert` functions.

### 🧾 Popup Form  
Clicking the **“Create Account”** button displays a centered registration form (by changing `display: none → flex`).

### 🌙 Dynamic Theme Change  
Clicking the **“Change Theme”** button activates a **dark mode** and applies a **grayscale filter** to the hero section image.

### 🧭 Smooth Layout  
The header is sticky, and sections are horizontally aligned using **Flexbox** for a smooth and clean layout.
